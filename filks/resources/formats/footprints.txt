One night I dreamed a dream.
As I was {walking/vbg} along the {beach/nn} with my {Lord/nn=lord}.
Across the {dark/jj} {sky/nn} {flashed/vbd} {scenes:2/nn=scene} from my {life/nn=life}.
For each {scene:1/nn=scene}, I noticed two sets of {footprints/nns=footprints} in the {sand/nn=sand},
One belonging to me and one to my {Lord/nn=lord}.

After the last {scene:1/nn=scene} of my {life/nn=life} flashed before me,
I looked back at the {footprints/nns=footprints} in the {sand/nn=sand}.
I noticed that at many {times/nns=times} along the path of my {life/nn=life},
especially at the very {lowest/jjt} and {saddest/jjt=saddest} times,
there was only one set of {footprints/nns=footprints}.

This really {troubled/vbd} me, so I asked the {Lord/nn=lord} about it.
"{Lord/nn=lord}, you said once I decided to {follow/vb} you,
You'd {walk/vb} with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the {saddest/jjt=saddest} and most {troublesome/jj} {times/nns=times} of my {life/nn=life},
there was only one set of {footprints/nns=footprints}.
I don't understand why, when I {needed/vbd} You the most, You would {leave/vb=leave} me."

He whispered, "My {precious/jj} {child/nn}, I {love/vb} you and will never {leave/vb=leave} you
Never, ever, during your {trials/nns} and {testings/nns}.
When you saw only one set of {footprints/nns=footprints},
It was then that I {carried/vbd} you."
